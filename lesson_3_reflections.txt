When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I would like to work from several different computers.
When there is someone else who also works on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if I'm working on the project, I would like to have unchanged version of files,
but not to find out that files are rewritten because of somebody pushed some code to GitHub.
